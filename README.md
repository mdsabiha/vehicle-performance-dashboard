# 🚗 Vehicle Performance and Environmental Impact Analysis

This project analyzes how different vehicle characteristics impact fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Using Tableau, we built an interactive dashboard to help consumers, manufacturers, and policymakers make informed decisions based on environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard visualizes:
- **Fuel efficiency** across vehicle classes
- **CO2 emissions** based on engine size and cylinder count
- **Impact of transmission types** on fuel consumption
- **Relationship between CO2 and smog ratings**
- **Fuel type comparison (gas, hybrid, electric)**

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Minicompact cars** are the most fuel-efficient.
- **SUVs and specialty vehicles** have high CO2 emissions.
- **Electric vehicles** lead in low emissions.
- **Manual transmissions** offer better fuel economy.
- **Larger engine sizes and more cylinders** correlate with higher fuel consumption.
